## Shopify Frontend Internship Challenge by Luka Mircetic
Welcome to Spacestagram the frontend web app that shows a feed of NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day pictures.

Some features include:
- Chronological feed of photos pulled from NASA's database
- Infinite scroll (more photos are fetched so the feed never ends)
- Saved likes (when a user likes/unlikes a post and then refreshes/closes the page, the liked posts will be saved)
- Animated like/ loading animations
